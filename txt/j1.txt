There is something so soothing about beginning a project you love, like striking the first match in the dark. That quiet spark. I felt it again tonight, drafting a small, silly website.

Maybe this is my way of rediscovering myself. A slow return, step by step, to the things that make me happy. To the pieces of me I thought I had misplaced somewhere in the years.

Sometimes I feel older than I am, like I’ve carried the weight of too many lives at once. Stories folded up and tucked away, too heavy to share. So here I am, writing them out for whoever might wander close enough to read.

Perhaps this is its own kind of atonement. Laying my sins bare on the endless sea of the internet, open to be witnessed, to be met with a ringing bell and a chorus of shame, pelted with rotten fruit. And yet, I laugh. Anyhow

There is a strange delight in starting all over again. In finding new loves, new pieces of light, new ways to understand who I am. I’ve always adored the phrase, “We Are a Mosaic of Everyone We've Ever Loved” And isn’t it true? Everyone lives on, because some fragment of them remains in you. A word, a laugh, a kindness, an immortality scattered in small, fragments.

Still, I’ve never been good at being left alone. My life has been stitched with patterns of leaving. Sometimes chosen for me and sometimes chosen by me. And when no choice seemed possible, I was the one to cut the thread. I knew I was doing it, and yet it exhausted me to stop myself. To stay. To let it unravel on its own.

And yet even in solitude I like to imagine the pieces of myself I’ve left behind. Proof that I existed, that I loved, that in a brief moment, I belonged to their story too.

Everything feels like a win when the goal is simply to experience.

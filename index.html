	    "Before Colonization": `
        
	      <h1>Before Colonization</h1>
	      <p>Before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, many communities in the Philippines lived in ways that were far more fluid and inclusive than what we know today. 
			Gender was not strictly binary, nor was it always tied to anatomy. It was deeply connected to community roles, spirituality, and balance.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Fluid Roles in Society</h3>
			<p>Precolonial Filipino society was not without gender distinctions, but these distinctions were flexible and complementary rather than oppressive. 
				Men often hunted, fought, or led, while women oversaw domestic tasks, weaving, and child-rearing. Yet both men and women shared responsibilities in agriculture, from cultivating plants to repairing irrigation canals and rice terraces. 
				There really was no strict ban on switching roles—responsibilities shifted according to the needs of the community (Garcia, 2009; Johnson, 1997; McKay, 1999).</p>
			<br>

			<p>Women were not confined to domestic spaces. They could inherit property, divorce, and even lead communities. Reid (2009) notes that while many Southeast Asian traditions resisted female monarchy, Austronesian societies like the Philippines welcomed women as rulers and chiefs. Aguja (2013) echoes this, showing that women could become barangay leaders or serve as babaylan, with equal rights in family and property.</p>

			<br><h3>Spiritual Balance and the Babaylan</h3>
			<p>
		  	Central to this balance were the Babaylan. They are respected healers, shamans, and ritual leaders whose authority stemmed not from gender but from spiritual connection, wisdom, and healing ability. 
			The role was usually filled by women, but not exclusively. Male babaylan, known as asog or bayoguin, were effeminate or queer individuals who also held authority. This reflects a society where gender diversity was accepted as part of community life (Salazar, 1999).
			</p>
			<br>

			<p>
				As Zeus Salazar explained, “woman” in precolonial society was not just a biological category but a construct of duty, responsibility, and societal role (Ang Babaylan sa Kasaysayan ng Pilipinas). 
				The Babaylan embodied nurturing, intuition, and communal care, qualities that made them essential spiritual figures. Their authority was respected, and their gender variance was not stigmatized but woven into the sacred fabric of society.
			</p>
			<br>

			<h3>Cosmology and Equality</h3>
			<p>
				Beliefs in gender balance were also spiritual. Animism and nature-based cosmologies framed men and women as two ends of a spectrum, neither superior to the other. Paterno (1887) described how Tagalog concepts of divinity often emphasized union and mutuality, rejecting subordination. 
				The myth of Malakas and Maganda, where man and woman emerge from bamboo together, symbolizes this equality.
			</p>
            <br>

			<h3>ASociety of Balance</h3>
			<p>
				Precolonial Filipinos lived in a world where roles were dynamic, where women and queer figures could lead, and where spirituality recognized fluidity as sacred. Gender was not a source of hierarchy but of harmony. A balance later disrupted by colonization.
			</p>

	    "Colonial Disruption": `
	      
            <h1>Colonial Disruption</h1>
                    <p>The arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century brought profound disruption to the gender balance of precolonial Filipino society. 
                        What was once fluid and inclusive became reshaped under Catholic patriarchal frameworks, enforced through religion, law, and cultural institutions.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>The Demonization of the Babaylan</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of the clearest disruptions was the demonization of the Babaylan. Spiritual leaders which were often women or queer individuals, was rebranded by Spanish colonizers as witches (brujas), their practices labeled heretical. This colonial strategy stripped them of authority and sought to erase indigenous ways of knowing. By dismantling the role of the Babaylan, the colonizers undermined both gender inclusivity and communal spirituality (Gaborro, 2009).</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Catholic Patriarchy and Education</h3>
                        <p>
                            Spanish colonization introduced a rigid gender order grounded in Catholic doctrine. Education became a key tool for reinforcing this system. As early as 1582, laws mandated separate schools for boys and girls in every parish. 
                            Boys were taught philosophy, grammar, and sciences (skills for leadership), while the girls were limited to religion and domestic training. 
                            Women’s intellectual development was deliberately restricted to enforce caregiving and chastity as their only “proper” roles (Rodriguez, 2022).</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            Elite religious institutions, such as the beaterios, exemplified this system. These convent-like schools for women promoted chastity, obedience, and domestic virtues. Initially open only to Spanish elites, they later accepted Filipinas through scholarships, spreading patriarchal Catholic ideals of femininity across the colony. Rodriguez (2022) argues that this was not simply education, but the “colonization of the Filipino mind,” where social advancement required internalizing colonial values.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h3>Patriarchal Restructuring of Society</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Spanish did more than demonize spiritual leaders or divide education. Tthey systematically restructured Filipino society into a patriarchal order. Women were relegated to caregiving roles, while men were positioned for leadership, public intellectual work, and governance. Over time, this colonial gender order became entrenched, carried forward into the American period and modern institutions.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            The consequences remain visible today: the erasure of female and queer leadership, the relegation of women to domestic spaces, and the internalized belief that power and intellect are inherently male domains.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Breaking the Balance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Colonization did not only disrupt individual roles; it changed the very worldview of balance and reciprocity that precolonial Filipinos lived by. By imposing binaries (male/female, leader/follower, priest/witch) Spanish colonizers created a system where fluidity was punished, and conformity to patriarchal norms was demanded. This breaking of balance marked the beginning of a cultural transformation whose effects continue to shape Filipino society centuries later.</p>

	    "Contemporary Struggles": ` 
        <h1>Contemporary Struggles</h1>
                <p>The colonial disruption of gender norms did not end with Spanish rule. Its effects remain deeply woven into the fabric of modern Filipino society. Across schools, workplaces, media, religion, government, and even activism, colonial-era patriarchal values continue to shape everyday life.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>The Philippine education system carries the imprint of its colonial past. Schools have historically reinforced patriarchal norms, separating intellectual labor for men from domestic training for women (Rodriguez, 2022).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>In basic education, outdated curricula continue to promote rigid views of gender and sexuality. Laxa (2020) critiques how textbooks and lessons reinforce stereotypes that stigmatize gender diversity. Abulencia et al. (2023), in a study on Marikina schools, found widespread gender-based bullying, discriminatory behavior by teachers, and unsafe environments for students who did not conform to gender norms.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Education, instead of being liberating, often perpetuates exclusion and silences those outside the binary.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Workplace Inequality</h3>
                    <p>The workplace is another space where colonial patriarchal systems persist. Professions are still gendered. Caregiving and education for women, leadership and technical fields for men. Women face systemic barriers such as the gender pay gap, the “glass ceiling,” and stereotyping (Esguerra, 2020).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Siapco’s research highlights that even with laws like the Magna Carta of Women and the Labor Code, many workers remain unaware of their rights, and discrimination continues across industries. Cultural dynamics reinforce inequality, leaving many women and queer individuals with limited opportunities for leadership.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Media and Popular Culture</h3>
                    <p>Media is a powerful cultural mirror, and in the Philippines, it often reflects patriarchal and heteronormative values.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Santoniccolo et al. (2023) show how global media normalizes objectification, body shame, and sexist scripts. Locally, Prieler and Centeno (2023) find that Filipino advertisements portray men as experts and women as homemakers, reinforcing traditional roles.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>While queer visibility has grown, it remains limited and often caricatured. Dogcol and Villanueva (2024) reveal that LGBT characters in Philippine commercials are sanitized, placed in private settings, or portrayed for humor which fails to challenge mainstream norms.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Gendered Violence and Human Rights</h3>
                    <p>Colonial legacies of control manifest in continued violence against women, LGBTQ+, and gender-nonconforming individuals.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Human Rights Watch (2017) documented widespread bullying of LGBT students in schools, including haircut restrictions and forced conformity, often ignored by administrators. The Psychological Association of the Philippines (2011) warned that such discrimination has long-term effects on mental health.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Mendoza and Strobel (2013) link this violence to colonization’s erasure of gender diversity, especially the suppression of the Babaylan. Today, older LGBTQ+ Filipinos face exclusion, housing insecurity, and abuse from family and community (EnGendeRights & Outright International, 2023).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Despite existing protections like the Magna Carta of Women, the lack of a SOGIE Equality Bill highlights how incomplete legal frameworks remain, keeping colonial norms embedded in law.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>The Church’s Influence</h3>
                    <p>Religion continues to shape gender norms in powerful ways. Catholicism, introduced during colonization, remains dominant wiht over 78% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic (PSA, 2020).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>The Church’s stance often blocks progressive policies. Reyes et al. (2019) link religiosity with heightened homonegativity, while ARROW (2022) documents how Catholic fundamentalist groups delayed or opposed the Reproductive Health Law and sex education reforms.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>By promoting patriarchal views of family and gender, the Church continues the colonial legacy of marginalizing women and queer communities.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Internet Culture and Queer Expression</h3>
                    <p>Digital platforms have become new spaces for resistance, especially for youth. TikTok, Twitter, and Facebook provide tools for queer Filipinos to explore gender identities and resist colonial binaries. Alcazaren and Labor (2023) call these “queered affordances”, digital tools that empower nonconforming expression.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Online communities also offer belonging. Hapal (2022) notes how queer Filipinos use Twitter as a support system, while Espina et al. (2024) show how media engagement helps youth affirm their queerness.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Yet, online spaces mirror offline discrimination. Hate speech, cyberbullying, and harassment remain widespread (Mental Health PH, 2022). The internet can liberate, but it is also contested terrain.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Government and Policy</h3>
                    <p>Philippine laws still reflect colonial patriarchal structures.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>For instance, maternity leave is extensive while paternity leave remains minimal, reinforcing caregiving as women’s duty (RA 8187; Expanded Maternity Leave Law). Rules in schools about haircuts and uniforms punish gender-nonconforming students (HRW, 2017).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>The long-stalled <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.ph/campaigns/sogiesc">SOGIE Equality Bill</a> , first filed in 2000, continues to face opposition despite strong public support for LGBTQ+ rights. Surveys reveal contradictions: while many Filipinos favor equal protections, nearly half oppose trans women accessing women’s restrooms (SWS, 2019).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Local governments like Quezon City have implemented inclusive policies, but these are often isolated gestures. Symbolic efforts like rainbow pedestrian lanes highlight how visibility can be performative rather than systemic.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Youth Culture and Activism</h3>
                    <p>Filipino youth are at the forefront of challenging colonial gender norms. Online campaigns such as #BabaeAko and #TransRightsAreHumanRights show how digital activism fuels national conversations (Dayrit et al., 2022).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>Youth-led movements connect gender justice with wider struggles like reproductive health, sexual violence, and safe spaces. Yet, even activist spaces are not free from contradictions. Research shows how misogyny and exclusion can still persist within feminist or queer movements (Hega et al., 2017).</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>True decolonization requires not just resisting institutions but also confronting internalized patriarchal practices within movements themselves.</p>
                    <br>

	    "Resistance & Reimagination": `
                    
            <h1>Resistance & Reimagination</h1>
                    <p>Despite centuries of colonial disruption, Filipinos continue to resist, reimagine, and reclaim ways of living beyond patriarchal and binary norms. Resistance comes in many forms. Feminist movements, queer expression, cultural revival, and the re-centering of indigenous traditions like those of the <em>Babaylan.</em> These acts are not only protests against oppression but also pathways to healing and imagining freer futures.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Feminism and Women’s Movements</h3>
                        <p>Philippine feminism has long been a force of resistance. From early women’s suffrage movements to contemporary campaigns against gender-based violence, feminism has challenged patriarchal systems inherited from colonization.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Modern feminists connect gender issues with broader struggles for democracy, social justice, and labor rights. Hega et al. (2017) note that these movements expose contradictions within society: while women often lead community activism, they still face exclusion in formal political spaces. Yet, the continued rise of women-led organizations shows how Filipinas reassert agency in spaces historically denied to them.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Decolonial Thought and Babaylan Recovery</h3>
                        <p>A growing movement looks back to precolonial traditions as sources of strength. Scholars such as Strobel (2010) and Mendoza & Strobel (2013) emphasize the Babaylan as symbols of decolonial feminist thought. Figures who embody fluidity, spirituality, and care. By recovering these traditions, Filipinos challenge Western-imposed binaries and reconnect with indigenous ways of knowing.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>It is not about romanticizing the past but about re-centering cultural memory as a tool for reimagining the future. Decolonial thought asks us to see colonial gender norms as neither natural nor permanent, but as systems that can be unlearned.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Online Queer Expression</h3>
                        <p>Digital platforms have become key spaces of resistance. Filipino queer youth use TikTok, Twitter, and other platforms to express gender creativity outside traditional binaries. Alcazaren & Labor (2023) call these “queered affordances”, digital tools that let users remix identity and visibility on their own terms.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Hapal (2022) describes Twitter as a support system where queer Filipinos build communities, share resources, and affirm identities often erased offline. These online spaces are imperfect. Cyberbullying and hate speech remain, but they allow queer expression to flourish in ways that resist colonial and religious constraints.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Cultural Resistance</h3>
                        <p>Resistance also takes the form of reclaiming art, storytelling, and cultural practice. Mendoza & Strobel (2013) describe this as a form of “cultural decolonization” using music, ritual, and oral history to push back against imposed norms.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>For many, reimagination comes through hybrid forms: zines, spoken word, theater, and indie games that carry both ancestral memory and modern struggles. By reclaiming the Babaylan, queer histories, and indigenous values of kapwa (shared being), activists and artists are weaving together tradition and modernity as acts of survival and creation.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Youth Activism</h3>
                        <p>Young Filipinos are often at the center of these movements. Campaigns like #BabaeAko and #TransRightsAreHumanRights show how youth use digital tools to connect gender advocacy with broader struggles for equality (Dayrit et al., 2022).</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Yet as Hega et al. (2017) cautions, even progressive movements can carry patriarchal blind spots. True resistance means not only confronting institutions like church and state but also examining contradictions within activist spaces themselves.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Reimagining...</h3>
                        <p>Resistance is not only about saying no to oppression.. It is about imagining something new. Whether through feminism, queer visibility, digital creativity, or cultural revival, Filipinos continue to envision futures that reject colonial binaries and honor indigenous wisdom.</p>
                        <br>

	    "Play as Resistance": `                    
            <h1>Play as Resistance</h1>
                    <p>Games are more than just entertainment. They are spaces for storytelling, empathy, and imagination. In the Philippines, where colonial legacies still shape ideas of gender, games offer a powerful way to resist and reimagine. Through play, we can explore histories erased by colonization, experience perspectives different from our own, and imagine futures beyond binaries.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Games as Tools for Education</h3>
                        <p>Research shows that games can engage players in deep learning experiences that traditional classrooms cannot. Gee (2003) argues that video games teach players how to problem-solve, role-play, and think critically by immersing them in systems and stories.</p>
                        <br>

                        <center><img src="image/neveralone.png" alt="Never Alone" class="sidebar-img">
                        </center>

                        <p>For gender and cultural issues, this means that players can learn not just facts, but lived perspectives. Games like <a href="https://neveralonegame.com">Never Alone (Kisima Inŋitchuŋa)</a>, developed with the Iñupiat people of Alaska, show how interactive media can preserve and share indigenous stories while educating a global audience.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Games and Empathy</h3>
                        <p>One of the most powerful aspects of games is their ability to foster empathy. Playing through a character’s perspective allows players to experience emotions and struggles they may never face in real life.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <center><img src="image/lifeisstrange.png" alt="Life is Strange" class="sidebar-img">
                        <img src="image/dreamdaddy.png" alt="Dream Daddy" class="sidebar-img">
                        </center>

                        <p>For example, <a href="https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com">Life is Strange</a> explores queer relationships and mental health through choice-based storytelling, allowing players to engage intimately with marginalized perspectives. <a href="https://dreamdaddy.itch.io/dream-daddy">Dream Daddy</a>, a queer dating simulator, challenges stereotypes by centering gay romance in a wholesome, humanizing way. These games reveal how play can normalize diversity and build compassion.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Cultural Recovery and Decolonization</h3>
                        <p>In the Philippine context, games can act as decolonial tools. Countering colonial narratives by re-centering indigenous traditions and gender fluidity. Strobel (2010) and Mendoza & Strobel (2013) highlight how recovering Babaylan practices is a form of cultural healing. By weaving these traditions into interactive narratives, games can reconnect Filipino youth to precolonial histories that schools and media often ignore.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Our project builds on this approach. By designing a game inspired by Babaylan traditions, we aim to create not just a play experience, but a decolonial encounter, to invite players to reflect on how colonial gender norms took hold, and how indigenous practices can inspire alternative futures.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Why Play Matters</h3>
                        <p>Play is one of the most human ways of learning, imagining, and creating meaning. As Bogost (2007) notes, games carry persuasive power; they can challenge beliefs and spark new ways of thinking. In a society where colonial gender norms still dominate, games provide a way to question, resist, and reimagine.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Through interactive storytelling, play becomes resistance. Resistance against forgetting, against binaries, and against imposed systems of control. It becomes a way to learn, to unlearn, and to dream of worlds where inclusivity and balance are once again possible.</p>
                        <br>
